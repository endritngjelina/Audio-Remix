# Audio‑Remix

A lightweight collection of **HTML/CSS/JS** experiments exploring audio playback and UI behaviors.  
Each page (`Audio Remix 0.html` … `Audio Remix 8.html`) is a standalone iteration—open one in your browser to try that version.

## ✨ What’s inside

- **Pure front‑end:** no frameworks, no bundlers—just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
- **Versioned iterations:** numbered files show how the idea evolved step by step.
- **Tinker‑friendly:** easy to fork, compare, and modify.

## 🚀 Getting started

1. **Clone or download** this repo.
2. **Open any** `Audio Remix N.html` file directly in your browser (double‑click or drag into a tab).
3. If your browser blocks local audio for security reasons, start a tiny static server:
   - **Python 3:** `python -m http.server 8000` → visit `http://localhost:8000`
   - **Node (npx):** `npx serve` → follow the printed URL

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- **HTML5** for structure and audio elements
- **CSS3** for layout and styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity (no external libraries)

---

## 🧭 Roadmap ideas

- Combine the best bits from several versions into a single page
- Add keyboard controls and simple accessibility tweaks (focus states, labels)
- Optional Web Audio API enhancements (visualizers, gain/pan controls)
